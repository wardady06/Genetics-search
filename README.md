Hey welcome to my genetics project, as a data sicentist, I always wanted to be helpull for people, so I decide to make this project in the way to become a better data scientist ! 

this took me  a lot of work and got a 2 parts project, first you will find data visualization, and in a second time, you will get the model training to predict. 

run it on a jupyter not book or copy and past the code on a .py as you want !
